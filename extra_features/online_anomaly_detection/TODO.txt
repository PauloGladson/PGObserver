- evaluate metrics on every point where MVA > window historical avg * abnormal_jump_pct (100), so that slow monotonous growth would be captured
- add some seasonality (at same time x days ago) metric next to pure statistical ones ?
- flag to auto-adjust sensitivity if getting more than X alerts per day
- some feedback system + UI for storing known OK patters or known error patterns
- heuristics for saw-tooth patterns
- start using stddev dev pct instead the absolute number
- if --drop-spikes wait at least 1 point before alerting ?
- alert only if avg. point timestamp distance > X, so that zB low frequency sproc calls would not be included
- fetch history if a new ident comes online (cont. mode)
- heartbeat table to enable creating some checks that the script is running
- new metric - cache hit rate for tables > X
- make *_filter.sql params (table size, share of total sproc runtime etc) configurable from DB so that they could be host based
