features:
  calculate_deltas: true    # if false, exactly what is returned from gatherers is sent to output plugins
  simple_deltas: false      # by default "change rates" are calculated i.e. deltas divided by passed time.
                            # when true (default for "console mode") then just pure delta values are passed to output
# FYI
# - even when some metrics are enabled here they might not be be actually enabled on single host level (hosts.host_settings)
# - plugins can be declared multiple times with different parameters
# - if "metrics" node is defined, only listed metrics data will be processed by this plugin
